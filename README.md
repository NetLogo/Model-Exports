# Model Exports

This repository contains dumped `export-world` and `export-view` output files for all models in the NetLogo Models Library.  Its primary purpose is for use in NetLogo's testing infrastructure, serving as a historical reference, so as to alert the core NetLogo developers when the output of `export-world` or `export-view` has changed, which most likely indicates that model behavior has changed.
